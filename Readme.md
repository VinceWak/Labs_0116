### Project | Module 3

## Project Goal
In this project, we will work on unsupervised machine learning. 
Imagine you are Uber and you want to give recommendations on where drivers should be to maximize their chances of finding a ride.
We will use Machine Learning to create this recommendation algorithm.


Take the following dataset: [uber-trip-data](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-tlc-foil-response/tree/master/uber-trip-data)
Group1: April
Group2: May
Group3: June
Group4: July
Group5: August
Group6: September

1. Try to see the number of optimal clusters
2. Find these clusters on a map
3. Now separate these clusters according to the time of day
4. Look at the difference between KMeans and DBSCAN



## Expectations

- Clean, well-commented code
- Clean data with EDA
- Clear board in Trello with logged time for each task
- Clear descriprion of each model
- At least 3 different models including Kmeans and DBSCAN
- Use Elbow method
- Use folium library to create the map
- Models implementation and comparison
- Vizualisation of the main results


## Deliverables

- '1. Uber.csv with clean and encoded data
- '2. Uber.ipynb' with all code concerning data cleaning and modelling
- '3. Slides/dashboard/notebook with your results (for each model and final table with models comparison).
- '4. Please state the conclusion about usability of each model.
- '5. Trello board.



Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
