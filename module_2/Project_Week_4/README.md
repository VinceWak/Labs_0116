## Introduction

This project aims to recap EDA and to learn how to create dashboards and, actually, applications, suitable at least for piloting new ideas or products.
Your data is here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Dwaa32bNiNe0f67o27bJXw-08nh2HsiN


## Project Goal
The goals of this project is to apply the data preparation knowledge and to train more in  Python, SQL and Streamlit.

- Plan your work
- Manage your git repository.
- Build your code from scratch.
- Put into practice the basic data processing concepts learned during the week.
- Get used to public presentations.

## Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for this project are as follows:

* We are going to use Trello for this project. 
* We provide you a dataset of real data. Thus, there is some probability of having issues there.
* Examine the dataset for the possible issues
* Clean it if necessary. Please note, that it could be that missing data treatment and encoding are not required.
* Analyze your data using statistics, crosstab, groupby, pivots, and charts.
* Develop the idea for your charts:
 - what exactly you want to show?
 - what should be the layout?
 - which chart represent the most powerful insights?
 - is there a color scheme that correspond with your data and your task?
* Please note,  you need to create 12 charts using Matplotlib and 12 charts using Seaborn. Each set should have the distinct chart types including linear, bar, scatter, boxplot, pie, radar, multiple series chart and 3D charts..
* After your dashboard is ready, please, create a presentation 

## Necessary Deliverables

The following deliverables should be pushed to your Github repo for this chapter.

* **CSV file with clean data** containing the results of your data for the visualization.
* **Python file** containing all Python code and commands.
* **A ``README.md`` file** containing a detailed explanation of the process including explanation of the dashboard development
* **link to the Github repo with project (should be sent before 12 PM on Monday)
* **Slides** containing all the necessary details and outputs of your project

## Presentation

The presentation time limit is **5 minutes** (I begin to think that this is impossible, but ...)! You will have **10 minutes** to present your project to the class and then **5 minutes** for Q&A.

The slides of your presentation must include the content listed below:

- Title of the project + Student name
- Description of your dataset
- Challenges
- Process (don't forget to explain your decisions)
- Learnings
- Improvements
- Comparison of the initial and final datasets
- Highlights



## Suggested Ways to Get Started

- **Examine the data and come up with a deliverable**
- **Break the project down into different steps** 
- **Use the tools in your tool kit** 
- **Work through the lessons in class** 
- **Commit early, commit often**
