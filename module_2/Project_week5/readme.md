## Introduction

This project aims to recap EDA and to learn how to create dashboards and, actually, applications, suitable at least for piloting new ideas or products.
Your data is here: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/4/folders/1Dwaa32bNiNe0f67o27bJXw-08nh2HsiN
The placeholder for your Kanban board is indicated at the wall by number of your group


## Project Goal
The goals of this project is to apply the data preparation knowledge and to train more in  Python, SQL and Streamlit.

- Plan your work
- Manage your git repository.
- Build your code from scratch.
- Put into practice the basic data processing concepts learned during the week.
- Get used to public presentations.

## Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for this project are as follows:

* We are going to use the Kanban board (offline) for this project. 
* We provide you a dataset of real data. Thus, there is some probability of having issues there.
* Examine the dataset for the possible issues
* Clean it if necessary. Please note, that it could be that missing data treatment and encoding are not required.
* Analyze your data using statistics, crosstab, groupby, pivots, and charts.
* Develop the idea of your dashboard:
 - what exactly you want to show?
 - what should be the layout?
 - which widgets represent the most powerful insights?
 - is there a color scheme that cvorrespond with your data and your task?
* Your dashboards should have the elements for the data management (slider, checkboxes, etc); data input and data output (charts, text, tables)
* Please note, that you need to have at least 12 widgets that describe your data.
* Describe the idea of the dashboard and each widget (what you want to show, why the particular chart is chosen) in the readme file.
* After your dashboard is ready, please, create a presentation 

## Necessary Deliverables

The following deliverables should be pushed to your Github repo for this chapter.

* **CSV file with clean data** containing the results of your data for the visualization.
* **Python file** containing all Python code and commands.
* **A ``README.md`` file** containing a detailed explanation of the process including explanation of the dashboard development
* **A photo of your Kanban board** showing all the tasks that were done
* **link to the deployed version on Heroku** can be added to your readme
* **Slides** containing all the necessary details and outputs of your project

## Presentation

The presentation time limit is **5 minutes** (I begin to think that this is impossible, but ...)! You will have **3 minutes** to present your project to the class and then **2 minutes** for Q&A.

The slides of your presentation must include the content listed below:

- Title of the project + Student name
- Description of your dataset
- Challenges
- Process (don't forget to explain your decisions)
- Learnings
- Improvements
- Comparison of the initial and final datasets
- Highlights



## Suggested Ways to Get Started

- **Examine the data and come up with a deliverable**
- **Break the project down into different steps** 
- **Use the tools in your tool kit** 
- **Work through the lessons in class** 
- **Commit early, commit often**
